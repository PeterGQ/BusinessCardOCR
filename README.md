# BusinessCardOCR
Scenario:
On Campus Recruiting Event
-  Student: "I had a great time getting to know more about the work you do at WhiteStone Corporation."
-  Recruiter: "Yea, here take my business card and send me your resume."
-  Student: "alright, Thank you."
-  Student takes business card and puts it in their pocket along with the 50 other cards they received that night.

2 months later.
- Student: "Hey, where did that business card go for that one recruiter. If only I had a way of saving that information somewhere."
# The Problem
  This is a problem I, as a college student, have had to go through. You go to an event meet recruiters and put their card in your pocket. Eventually you end up losing the card because you forgot to transfer it somewhere safe. the simple solution would be to just take a picture of it, but what if you take that one step further. my proposed solution is to have an app or webpage that allows you to take a picture of a business card, scrap the data and add that data to an excel/google sheet to keep for your own record.
